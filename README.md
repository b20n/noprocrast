## Avoid distractions

This is a quick hack to compromise between having no access to your time-wasting sites and, well, wasting time on them. I wrote it because I was tired of using silly hacks to view the occasional HN article.

Point your time-wasting hostnames to an instance this server in your hosts file, and you'll be allowed (by default) 15 minutes of access time before being locked out for three hours.

I'll probably add some more parameters soonish. If you'd like to test it out, there's a copy of this running at 50.17.181.19. It's just an EC2 micro instance, however, so please play nice.
